EECE 5554 LAB4
Shuchong Wang

I'm not recording data for this lab, therefore I'm not including data and driver folders.
The only folder inside src/ is analysis.
I used MATLAB for this lab.
If you want to run the code on your end, make sure to change the file path.
The circle.m analyzed first part of lab data which recorded in Ruggles Station roundabout.
The drive.m analyzed remaining part of lab data which is a mini BackBay tour.
The figures and Xc(IMU Offset result) will display automatically if the script has been executed successfully.
Thanks for reading.
